## Introduction
### Learning Objectives
## Know Your Environment

**1. Demystify the Terminal**

* **What it is:**  Explain the terminal as a powerful interface to interact directly with the computer, going beyond the limitations of graphical interfaces.
* **Why it's Essential:** Emphasize its importance for generative AI tasks, such as:
    *  Managing code and data
    *  Installing and running AI tools and libraries
    *  Executing and monitoring AI model training
    *  Automating repetitive tasks

**2. Basic Navigation**

* **Present Working Directory:** Introduce the concept of a current location within the file system.
* **Key Commands:**
    * `pwd` (print working directory): Show where you are.
    * `ls` (list): Display files and folders in the current location. Explain options like `-l` (long listing) for detailed information, and `-a` (all) to see hidden files.
    * `cd` (change directory): Move between directories. Explain using `..` to go up one level.
    * `mkdir` (make directory): Create new folders.
    * `touch` (create empty file): Make new, empty files.

**3. File Manipulation**

* `cp` (copy): Duplicate files and directories.
* `mv` (move): Relocate files and directories (also used for renaming).
* `rm` (remove): Delete files and directories. Emphasize caution with `rm -rf` (recursive force) as it permanently deletes.

**4. Working with Text**

* `cat` (concatenate): Display file contents.
* `less`: View file contents with scrolling and searching (essential for long files).
* `head`: Display the first few lines of a file.
* `tail`: Display the last few lines of a file (useful for logs).

**5. CLI Concepts**

* **Commands:**  Explain the structure of a typical command: `command [options] [arguments]`.
* **Options/Flags:** Clarify how options modify command behavior. Use examples like `ls -l` to illustrate.
* **Arguments:** Explain that arguments are the inputs to the command (e.g., filenames).
* **Piping (`|`):** Briefly introduce the concept of chaining commands together to perform more complex actions.
* **Redirection (`>` and `>>`):** Show how to save command output to a file.

**6. Important Tips**

* **Tab Completion:** Encourage using tab to autocomplete commands and filenames, reducing errors.
* **Command History:**  Show how to use the up arrow key to access and reuse previous commands.
* **`man` command:** Explain how to access the manual pages for any command to get detailed help.

**7. Hands-on Practice**

* **Interactive Exercises:** Provide simple challenges to reinforce learning, such as navigating to specific directories, creating files, and listing contents.
* **Real-World Examples:** Relate these commands to generative AI tasks, like organizing datasets or installing Python libraries.

By focusing on these core concepts and providing practical examples, you'll empower your students to confidently navigate the terminal and leverage its power for their generative AI journey. Good luck with your course!
