# Introduction

In this course, you'll be building your own Generative AI-powered application, and to do that effectively, we'll be using a set of powerful command-line interface (CLI) tools. While it might seem a bit intimidating at first, 
you'll quickly gain proficiency with practice. 

**Why the Command Line?**

You might be wondering, "Why not just use a graphical user interface (GUI)?" While GUIs are user-friendly for basic tasks, the CLI offers several advantages, especially when working with generative AI:

* **Precision and Control:** The CLI gives you fine-grained control over every aspect of your project, from managing code and dependencies to interacting directly with AI models.
* **Automation and Efficiency:** You can automate repetitive tasks, saving you time and effort. Imagine training a model with a single command or deploying your application to the cloud with ease.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** The CLI makes it easier to share your work with others and collaborate on complex projects using version control systems like Git.
* **Unlocking AI Assistance:** Generative AI tools like Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT are particularly effective at assisting with CLI commands. They can help you you write commands, code, debug errors, and even suggest new approaches.

**Your CLI Arsenal**

Throughout this course, you'll become familiar with a range of powerful CLI tools:

* **Terminal and Shell:** Your gateway to the command line, providing a text-based interface to interact with your computer.
* **uv:** A modern tool for managing Python programming language based projects and their dependencies.
* **Git:** A version control system that allows you to track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.
* **GitHub:** A platform for collaboration, managing projects, and hosting your code. Its CLI client `gh` allows for minimal context-switching and better productivity.
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**  A suite of cloud computing services. Its CLI tool `gcloud` enables you to manage GCP resources from the command line.
* **Visual Studio Code:** A code editor with powerful CLI integration, enhancing your development workflow.
* **Starship:** A cross-shell prompt that provides a visually appealing and informative command-line experience.

**Connecting the Dots**

These CLI tools form the foundation for building, managing, and deploying your generative AI applications. You'll use them to:

* **Set up your development environment.**
* **Write and execute Python code.**
* **Manage project dependencies.**
* **Deploy and access AI models.**
* **Collaborate with teammates.**
* **Deploy your application to the cloud.**

Even if you're new to the command line, don't worry! This module will support your journey from getting started to gaining proficiency. 

# Terminal and Shell 
A terminal program (also known as a terminal emulator or command-line interface) is a text-based window that allows you to interact directly with your computer's operating system by typing commands. It's a powerful tool for managing files, running programs, and configuring system settings.

Here's how to access the terminal on different operating systems:

* **Windows:** Search for "Windows Terminal" in the Start Menu. If it is not pre-installed on your computer follow instructions from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)
* **macOS:** Open the "Terminal" application found in the Utilities folder within Applications.
* **Chrome OS:** Open the terminal application by searching for "Terminal" in the launcher.

A shell is a program that interprets the commands you type in a terminal and sends them to the computer's operating system to execute. It acts like a middleman between you and the computer, allowing you to control your system using text commands.

While often used interchangeably, a shell is different from a terminal:

* **Terminal:** The terminal is the window where you type commands. It's the visual interface.
* **Shell:** The shell is the program running *inside* the terminal that interprets those commands. It's the engine under the hood.

Here are the default shells in different operating systems:

* **macOS:** Zsh (Z shell)
* **Windows:** PowerShell
* **Chrome OS:** crosh (Chrome Shell)
* **Linux:** Bash (Bourne Again Shell)

This course primarily uses the Bash shell. While Zsh is also common, the differences won't significantly impact your learning. If your default shell isn't Bash or Zsh, follow the instructions below to ensure compatibility with typical cloud environments and AI/ML workflows.

# Git
Imagine Git as a time machine for your code, but with superpowers! Instead of saving countless versions of your files like "my_app_v1," "my_app_final," "my_app_really_final," Git tracks every single change you make. 

This is incredibly helpful in this course where you'll be constantly experimenting with AI prompts, model settings, and user interface designs. If a change causes problems, you can easily "rewind" to a previous, working version. Think of it as an "undo" button with infinite levels!

But Git does more than just version control:

* **Collaboration:** Git helps you seamlessly work with others on the same codebase. Everyone can contribute their changes without overwriting each other's work. This is crucial for your group projects!
* **Progress Tracking:**  You'll be showcasing your project weekly. With Git, you can "tag" each week's release, making it easy to compare and contrast your progress over time.  This also helps me (your instructor) track individual contributions and provide feedback.

Essentially, Git acts as a safety net, allowing you to experiment freely, collaborate effectively, and showcase your progress, all while ensuring your application remains operational despite rapid changes.

>**Installing Git**
>
> 1. **Check for Git:** Open your terminal and type `git --version`. If Git is already installed, you'll see its version number.
> 1. **Install if needed:** If Git isn't installed, download it from the official website [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

# uv
Imagine you're baking a cake. You wouldn't just throw all the ingredients together without measuring, right?  `uv` helps you do the same for your Python projects. It ensures you have the right "ingredients" (Python packages) and the right "amounts" (versions) so your code works correctly every time.

Why is this important?

* **Smoother Deployment:** In this course, you'll often deploy your project code to a cloud service and share it with your peers. uv ensures that your code runs smoothly across different environments by managing your project's dependencies and creating a reproducible Python setup. This simplifies the deployment process and helps your code work reliably wherever it's executed.
* **Consistency:**  Just like different flour brands can affect your cake, different Python package versions can affect your code. `uv` helps you avoid unexpected surprises.
* **Sharing:** If you share your "recipe" (code) with someone else, `uv` makes sure they can recreate it perfectly.
* **Future-proofing:** Even if Python changes in the future, your project will still work because `uv` keeps track of everything it needs.

Think of `uv` as a recipe book and ingredient list for your Python projects, keeping everything organized and consistent.

# Visual Studio Code
While you might be familiar with Jupyter notebooks, in this course, we'll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our primary code editor. VS Code is a versatile and powerful tool that goes beyond basic code editing, offering features that enhance your workflow and productivity, especially when working with generative AI.

Here's why we recommend VS Code:

* **Extensible and Customizable:** VS Code has a rich ecosystem of extensions that allow you to tailor it to your specific needs. Think of extensions like apps on your phone â€“ they add new functionalities and supercharge your coding experience.
* **Integrated Terminal:** Access the command line directly within VS Code, eliminating the need to switch between windows. This streamlined workflow is essential for efficient development.
* **AI-Powered Assistance:** Leverage extensions like GCP Code Cloud, GCP Gemini code assist, or GitHub Copilot to get AI-powered code suggestions, completions, and even generate entire code blocks, boosting your productivity and learning.
* **Excellent for Python Development:** VS Code provides robust support for Python, including features like intelligent code completion, debugging, and integration with popular Python tools.
