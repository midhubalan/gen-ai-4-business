Riley is eager to gain practical skills and explore the ethical implications of this rapidly evolving technology.

However, Riley's busy schedule means they have limited time for independent study and may need extra support with the more technical aspects of the course.  They're a bit apprehensive about keeping up with the fast pace of AI development but are excited to dive in and learn how to harness its power for creative marketing campaigns.
