### Late Submissions 

Please email ahead of time if you require more time to complete your assignments. I reserve the right to not grade unexcused late submissions. An automatic 5% grade point deduction per day from the submission date will be effected for repeated or unreasonably long delays.  

### Academic Integrity 

Students in this course will be expected to comply with the University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity. This may include, but is not limited to, the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of violating University Policy. Furthermore, no student may bring any unauthorized materials to an exam, including dictionaries and programmable calculators. 

To learn more about Academic Integrity, visit the Academic Integrity Guide for an overview of the topic. For hands- on practice, complete the Understanding and Avoiding Plagiarism tutorial. 

### Disability Services 

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and Disability Resources and Services (DRS), 140 William Pitt Union, (412) 648-7890, drsrecep@pitt.edu, (412) 228-5347 for P3 ASL users, as early as possible in the term. DRS will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course. 

### Classes Meeting During University-wide Closure

As articulated in the University-wide Closure and Class Cancellation Policy, it is the policy of the University of Pittsburgh to remain open, but in rare instances, circumstances beyond the University’s control may necessitate a closure of the University. Such circumstances may include severe weather, power outage, water main issues, and the like.

If feasible during a closure, I intend for our class to meet remotely at its regularly scheduled time. Refer to our class attendance policy if you are unable to attend.

Note to instructors: If you adopt this policy, please also indicate how the remote class session will be communicated and/or occur.  For example, “I will send you a remote connection link xx hours in advance of class” or “The class will meet using remote connection link published on Canvas or distributed through Pitt email.”

### Pitt Concern Connection

The University of Pittsburgh strives to build and maintain a positive and healthy working, learning, and living environment. Reporting concerns and asking questions can minimize the potential negative impact of inappropriate conduct on the University and our employees, faculty, and students. Reporting can help improve our culture and operations by identifying issues that require attention.

The Pitt Concern Connection is a dedicated reporting system where University members can elevate irregular or troublesome workplace, campus, and other issues so that they can be reviewed, addressed, and resolved. Report an issue or ask a question online, by telephone, or via text message.

The Pitt Concern Connection is not an emergency service. Immediate, life-threatening safety concerns should be reported to 911 or by contacting your local University police or security department.

### Statement on Scholarly Discourse 

In this course we will be discussing very complex issues of which all of us have strong feelings and, in most cases, unfounded attitudes. It is essential that we approach this endeavor with our minds open to evidence that may conflict with our presuppositions. Moreover, it is vital that we treat each other’s opinions and comments with courtesy even when they diverge and conflict with our own. We must avoid personal attacks and the use of ad hominem arguments to invalidate each other’s positions. Instead, we must develop a culture of civil argumentation, wherein all positions have the right to be defended and argued against in intellectually reasoned ways. It is this standard that everyone must accept in order to stay in this class; a standard that applies to all inquiry in the university, but whose observance is especially important in a course whose subject matter is so emotionally charged. 

### Statement on Classroom Recording 

To ensure the free and open discussion of ideas, students may not record classroom lectures, discussion and/or activities without the advance written permission of the instructor, and any such recording properly approved in advance can be used solely for the student’s own private use. 


### Your Well-being Matters
College/Graduate school can be an exciting and challenging time for students. Taking time to maintain your well-being and seek appropriate support can help you achieve your goals and lead a fulfilling life. It can be helpful to remember that we all benefit from assistance and guidance at times, and there are many resources available to support your well-being while you are at Pitt. You are encouraged to visit Thrive@Pitt to learn more about well-being and the many campus resources available to help you thrive.

If you or anyone you know experiences overwhelming academic stress, persistent difficult feelings and/or challenging life events, you are strongly encouraged to seek support. In addition to reaching out to friends and loved ones, consider connecting with a faculty member you trust for assistance connecting to helpful resources.

The University Counseling Center is also here for you. You can call 412-648-7930 at any time to connect with a clinician. If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal, please call the University Counseling Center at any time at 412-648-7930. You can also contact Resolve Crisis Network at 888-796-8226. If the situation is life threatening, call Pitt Police at 412-624-2121 or dial 911.
